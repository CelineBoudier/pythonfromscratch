pythonFromScratch
=================

pythonFromScratch addresses the issue of children going from visual programming (typically Scratch) to text based programming (typically Python). It is derived from experience in English schools but may be applicable elsewhere.

I teach Computer Studies in a high school in Namibia (14 - 16 years). We do not have the resources to have computers in the lessons but I also run an after-school PyNam Scholars (programming club) where I use RaspberryPy's. In lessons pupils learn algorithms using pseudo-code and flowcharts. They are required to understand the results of running different algorithms and constructing their own from a problem statement.
